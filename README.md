# Non-Consensual Intimate Images (NCII) violence

## International Legislation

### Definition

Non-consensual distribution or sharing of intimate or sexually explicit digital images of adults, colloquially known as “Revenge porn” (Revenge pornography), focusing on its nature and impacts, as well as implications for Italian legal responses. It is, however, a highly misleading expression, which has many stigmatising implications towards the victim of the diffusion of the images and it would be better, therefore, not to use it. Moreover, also the term porn is not properly used, the refers to a particular adult content, legitimate and for mass consumption. However, the terms ''non consensual pornography'' and ''revenge pornography'' entered in the literature, official documents and news and for this reason are also recalled in this document. We encourage to use the Non-Consensual Intimate Images (NCII) violence.
