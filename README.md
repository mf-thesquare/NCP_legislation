# Non-Consensual Intimate Images (NCII) violence

### Definition

Non-consensual distribution or sharing of intimate or sexually explicit digital images of adults is colloquially known as “Revenge porn” (Revenge pornography). It is, however, a highly misleading expression, which has many stigmatising implications towards the victim of the diffusion of the images and it would be better, therefore, not to use it. Moreover, also the term porn is not properly used, it refers to a particular adult content, legitimate and for mass consumption. However, the terms ''non consensual pornography'' and ''revenge pornography'' entered in the literature, official documents and news, and for this reason are also recalled in this document. We encourage to use the Non-Consensual Intimate Images (NCII) violence.
